# *stats220*

This is my repo for *STATS 220*. 

## A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in **Computer Science**.
- I am taking *STATS 220* because I want to understand the meaning behind data and how to interpret it effectively.
- I am interested in learning about the intersection of statistics and programming, and how to use data to solve real-world problems.
