# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

## A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to understand the meaning behind data and how to interpret it effectively.
- I am interested in learning about the intersection of statistics and programming, and how to use data to solve real-world problems.
